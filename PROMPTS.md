# AI Development Prompts for HM Model Viewer 3D

This document contains the complete conversation history and prompts used to create the HM Model Viewer 3D WordPress plugin using AI assistance.

## Overview

This plugin was entirely created through conversational AI, demonstrating how complex WordPress plugins can be built using AI assistance. The development process involved multiple iterations, refinements, and follows WordPress best practices.

## Complete Conversation History

### Initial Request
**User:** I need a wordpress plugin that allows embedding 3D models using model-viewer. It should be a new block type for gutenberg. I want to be able to upload glb files and have controls in the sidebar for the model-viewer attributes.

**AI Response:** Created the initial plugin structure with:
- Basic Gutenberg block registration
- GLB file upload support with proper MIME types
- Sidebar controls for model-viewer attributes
- Server-side rendering for frontend display

### Development Environment Setup
**User:** Can you now create a development environment so I can test this? Maybe using wp-env?

**AI Response:** Set up complete development environment with:
- wp-env configuration (.wp-env.json)
- npm scripts for environment management
- Webpack build system for modern JavaScript
- Development server with auto-rebuild
- Sample GLB files for testing

### Model-viewer Integration Issues
**User:** The model-viewer element isn't working correctly in the editor preview.

**AI Response:** Fixed ES module loading issues:
- Added proper script_loader_tag filter for ES modules
- Implemented model-viewer as ES module in both editor and frontend
- Fixed script enqueuing for web components

### Block Toolbar Enhancement
**User:** Add a Replace button to the block toolbar when a model is selected.

**AI Response:** Added BlockControls with toolbar:
- MediaUpload integration in toolbar
- Replace button with update icon
- Proper conditional rendering

### Code Quality Improvements
**User:** Convert all createElement calls to JSX and fix React Hooks warnings.

**AI Response:** Refactored entire block.js:
- Converted all wp.element.createElement to pure JSX
- Fixed React Hooks order (moved useRef and useEffect to top level)
- Improved code readability and maintainability

### Human Made Branding
**User:** Rebrand everything to Human Made instead of generic names.

**AI Response:** Complete rebranding:
- Updated plugin headers and namespaces
- Changed all constants to HM_ prefix
- Updated class names and text domain
- Modified package.json and documentation

### Development Workflow Improvements
**User:** Create a development server that auto-rebuilds and simplify the Docker setup.

**AI Response:** Enhanced development workflow:
- Added npm run dev script with webpack watch mode
- Simplified wp-env configuration
- Removed unnecessary Docker overrides
- Improved build process documentation

### UI/UX Enhancements - WordPress Core Patterns
**User:** Can you move the style related fields to the Style sidebar tab? e.g. background color

**AI Response:** Implemented WordPress native UI patterns:
- Moved style controls to InspectorControls group="styles"
- Separated content settings from styling options
- Added proper PanelColorSettings for native color picker
- Followed WordPress core block patterns

### Dimension Controls Enhancement
**User:** Can the width/height controls be like the core Image block with unit selectors?

**AI Response:** Added professional dimension controls:
- Implemented UnitControl with px, %, em, rem, vw, vh options
- Fallback to TextControl for compatibility
- Matching WordPress core Image block UI patterns

### Background Color Improvement
**User:** The background color doesn't look very WordPress native. Make it like the Group block.

**AI Response:** Fixed color control to match WordPress core:
- Replaced custom color picker with PanelColorSettings
- Native WordPress color palette integration
- Proper preview button and dropdown interface
- Consistent with all core WordPress blocks

### Environment Image Enhancement
**User:** Copy how the Group block handles the Background image for Environment Image.

**AI Response:** Implemented native WordPress image selection:
- Image preview thumbnails (40x40px)
- Filename display with truncation
- Card-like container with proper styling
- Remove button with modern WordPress button variants
- Consistent with Group block background image pattern

### Release Preparation
**User:** We're getting ready to release, let's setup a git repo with correct ignores.

**AI Response:** Complete Git repository setup:
- Initialized Git repository
- Comprehensive .gitignore for WordPress plugin development
- Enhanced README.md with full documentation
- Created release automation script
- Production build preparation
- Tagged v1.0.0 release with detailed commit message

### Code Standards and AI Transparency
**User:** Let's undo that release, we're not ready for v1 yet. I want to make sure all PHP code is using WordPress coding standards. Also add a disclaimer that this was written with AI and create a PROMPTS.md file.

**AI Response:** Code cleanup and transparency:
- Reverted premature release (removed v1.0.0 tag)
- Updated version to 0.9.0-dev (pre-release)
- Applied WordPress PHP Coding Standards throughout:
  - Proper spacing and indentation (tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment)
  - WordPress array formatting with trailing commas
  - Proper PHPDoc blocks with parameter and return types
  - WordPress naming conventions
  - Consistent use of WordPress functions and escaping
- Added AI transparency disclaimer to README.md
- Created comprehensive PROMPTS.md documenting entire development process
